Feature: move files
  As a user
  I want to move files
  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/data.zip" to "data.zip"

  Scenario: An attempt to move a file into a sub-folder using rename is not allowed
    Given user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has browsed to the files page
    When the user renames file "data.zip" to "simple-folder/data.zip" using the webUI
    Then near file "data.zip" a tooltip with the text 'File name cannot contain "/".' should be displayed on the webUI
