Feature: current oC10 behavior for issue-31276
  As an admin
  I want to be able to delete users
  So that I can remove user from ownCloud

  @issue-31276
  Scenario: normal user tries to delete a user
    Given using OCS API version "2"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    When user "Alice" deletes user "Brian" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "997"
    #Then the OCS status code should be "401"
    And the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And user "Brian" should exist
