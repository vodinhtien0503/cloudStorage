Feature: get users - current oC10 behavior for issue-31276
  As an admin, subadmin or as myself
  I want to be able to retrieve user information
  So that I can see the information

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"

  @issue-31276
  Scenario: normal user tries to get other users
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username         |
      | brand-new-user   |
      | another-new-user |
    When user "brand-new-user" gets the list of all users using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "997"
    #Then the OCS status code should be "401"
    And the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And the API should not return any data
