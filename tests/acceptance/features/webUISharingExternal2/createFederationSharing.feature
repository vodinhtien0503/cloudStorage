Feature: Federation Sharing - sharing with users on other cloud storages
  As a user
  I want to share files with any users on other cloud storages
  So that other users have access to these files

  Background:
    Given using server "REMOTE"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-empty-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "I am lorem.txt inside simple-folder" to "/simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And using server "LOCAL"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-folder"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "simple-empty-folder"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "I am lorem.txt inside simple-folder" to "/simple-folder/lorem.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/lorem.txt"
    And parameter "auto_accept_trusted" of app "federatedfilesharing" has been set to "no"


  Scenario: test the single steps of sharing a folder to a remote server
    Given user "Alice" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user shares folder "simple-folder" with federated user "Alice" with displayname "%username%@%remote_server_without_scheme%" using the webUI
    And user "Alice" from server "REMOTE" accepts the last pending share using the sharing API
    And the user shares folder "simple-empty-folder" with federated user "Alice" with displayname "%username%@%remote_server_without_scheme%" using the webUI
    And user "Alice" from server "REMOTE" accepts the last pending share using the sharing API
    And using server "REMOTE"
    Then as "Alice" folder "/simple-folder (2)" should exist
    And as "Alice" file "/simple-folder (2)/lorem.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" folder "/simple-empty-folder (2)" should exist

  Scenario: test the single steps of receiving a federation share
    Given using server "REMOTE"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |

      | Federated share | Do you want to add the federated share /simple-empty-folder from %username%@%remote_server_without_scheme%? | Brian |
      | Federated share | Do you want to add the federated share /lorem.txt from %username%@%remote_server_without_scheme%?           | Carol |
    When the user accepts the offered federated shares using the webUI
    Then file "lorem (2).txt" should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of file "lorem (2).txt" for user "Alice" on server "LOCAL" should be "I am lorem.txt"
