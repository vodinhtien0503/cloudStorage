Feature: propagation of etags when deleting a file or folder

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And parameter "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload"


  Scenario Outline: deleting a file changes the etags of all parents
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/upload/sub"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "/upload/sub/file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/upload/sub"
    When user "Alice" deletes file "/upload/sub/file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then these etags should have changed:
      | user  | path        |
      | Alice | /           |
      | Alice | /upload     |
      | Alice | /upload/sub |
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |
