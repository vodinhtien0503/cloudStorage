Feature: share with groups, group names are case-sensitive

  Background:
    Given the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And auto-accept shares has been disabled
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 1" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 2" to "/textfile2.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 3" to "/textfile3.txt"

  Scenario Outline: group names are case-sensitive, sharing with groups with different upper and lower case names
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And group "<group_id1>" has been created
    And group "<group_id2>" has been created
    And group "<group_id3>" has been created
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |
      | David    |
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "<group_id1>"
    And user "Carol" has been added to group "<group_id2>"
    And user "David" has been added to group "<group_id3>"
    When user "Alice" shares file "textfile1.txt" with group "<group_id1>" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Brian" accepts share "/textfile1.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the content of file "/Shares/textfile1.txt" for user "Brian" should be "ownCloud test text file 1"
    When user "Alice" shares file "textfile2.txt" with group "<group_id2>" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "Carol" accepts share "/textfile2.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the content of file "/Shares/textfile2.txt" for user "Carol" should be "ownCloud test text file 2"
    When user "Alice" shares file "textfile3.txt" with group "<group_id3>" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    When user "David" accepts share "/textfile3.txt" offered by user "Alice" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the content of file "/Shares/textfile3.txt" for user "David" should be "ownCloud test text file 3"

      | ocs_api_version | group_id1            | group_id2            | group_id3            | ocs_status_code |
