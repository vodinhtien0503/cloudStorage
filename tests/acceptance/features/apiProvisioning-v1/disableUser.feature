Feature: disable user
  As an admin
  I want to be able to disable a user
  So that I can remove access to files and resources for a user, without actually deleting the files and resources

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: admin disables an user
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When the administrator disables user "Alice" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Alice" should be disabled

    When the administrator disables the following users using the provisioning API
      | username |
      | a@-+_.b  |
      | a space  |
    Then the OCS status code of responses on all endpoints should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
    And the following users should be disabled
      | username |
