Feature: Sharing resources with different case names with the sharee and checking the coexistence of resources on sharee/receivers side

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |


  Scenario: sharing file with an internal user that has existing files with different case names
    Given user "Alice" has uploaded the following files with content "some data"
      | path             |
      | textfile.txt     |
      | text_file.txt    |
      | 123textfile.txt  |
