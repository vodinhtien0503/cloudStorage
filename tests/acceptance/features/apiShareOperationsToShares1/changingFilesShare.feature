Feature: sharing

  Background:
    Given the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And auto-accept shares has been disabled
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  Scenario Outline: moving a file into a share as recipient
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "Alice" has shared folder "/shared" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/shared" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Brian" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    When user "Brian" moves file "textfile0.txt" to "/Shares/shared/shared_file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then as "Brian" file "/Shares/shared/shared_file.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" file "/shared/shared_file.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |

  Scenario Outline: moving a file out of a share as recipient creates a backup for the owner
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has moved file "/textfile0.txt" to "/shared/shared_file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "/shared" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/shared" offered by user "Alice"
    And user "Brian" has moved folder "/Shares/shared" to "/shared_renamed"
    When user "Brian" moves file "/shared_renamed/shared_file.txt" to "/taken_out.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then as "Brian" file "/taken_out.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" file "/shared/shared_file.txt" should not exist
    And as "Alice" file "/shared_file.txt" should exist in the trashbin
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version |
      | old              |
      | new              |

  Scenario: Move files between shares by different users
    Given user "Carol" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
