Feature: propagation of etags when copying files or folders

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @skipOnOcis-OC-Storage @issue-product-280
  Scenario Outline: copying a file does not change its etag
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/file.txt" on path "/renamedFile.txt"
    When user "Alice" copies file "/file.txt" to "/renamedFile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then these etags should not have changed:
      | user  | path      |
      | Alice | /file.txt |
    And these etags should have changed:
      | user  | path             |
      | Alice | /                |
      | Alice | /renamedFile.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/folder"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/file.txt" on path "/folder/renamedFile.txt"
    When user "Alice" copies file "/file.txt" to "/folder/renamedFile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then these etags should not have changed:
      | user  | path      |
      | Alice | /file.txt |

  Scenario Outline: copying a file from one folder to an other changes the etags of destination
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/src"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "uploaded content" to "/src/file.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/dst"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/src"
    And user "Alice" has stored etag of element "/dst"
    When user "Alice" copies folder "/src/file.txt" to "/dst/file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then these etags should have changed:
      | user  | path |
      | Alice | /    |
      | Alice | /dst |
    And these etags should not have changed:
      | user  | path |
