Feature: sharing

  Background:
    Given the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And auto-accept shares has been disabled
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files


  Scenario: Uploading file to a user read-only share folder does not work
    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"

    When user "Brian" uploads file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/Shares/FOLDER/textfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
