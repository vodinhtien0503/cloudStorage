  Scenario Outline: Admin resets user password with special characters
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been deleted
    When the administrator creates user "brand-new-user" password "%alt1%" group "brand-new-group" using the occ command
    And user "brand-new-user" uploads file with content "some text" to "atextfile.txt" using the WebDAV API

    But user "brand-new-user" using password "%alt1%" should not be able to download file "atextfile.txt"
    Examples:
      | password                     | comment                               |
      | !@#$%^&*()-_+=[]{}:;,.<>?~/\ | special characters                    |

      | password with spaces         | password with spaces                  |

  Scenario: admin creates a user and specifies an invalid password, containing just space
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been deleted
    When the administrator creates user "brand-new-user" password "%alt1%" group "brand-new-group" using the occ command
    And user "Brand-New-User" uploads file with content "some text" to "/atextfile.txt" using the WebDAV API
    And the administrator resets the password of user "brand-new-user" to " " using the occ command
    Then the command should have failed with exit code 1
    And the content of file "atextfile.txt" for user "brand-new-user" using password "%alt1%" should be "some text"
    But user "brand-new-user" using password " " should not be able to download file "atextfile.txt"
