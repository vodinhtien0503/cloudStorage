Feature: create folder using MKCOL

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/PARENT/parent.txt"

  Scenario: send MKCOL requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MKCOL" including body "doesnotmatter" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |

      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

    Given user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When user "Brian" requests these endpoints with "MKCOL" including body "doesnotmatter" using the password of user "Alice"

  Scenario: send MKCOL requests to webDav endpoints using token authentication should not work
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user requests these endpoints with "MKCOL" using the generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |

  @notToImplementOnOCIS @issue-ocis-reva-37
  Scenario: send MKCOL requests to webDav endpoints using app password token as password
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user "Alice" requests these endpoints with "MKCOL" using basic auth and generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                       |
