Feature: get groups
  As an admin
  I want to be able to get groups

    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And group "España" has been created

    Then the groups returned by the API should be
      | España          |
      | admin           |
      | brand-new-group |
      | 0               |

  Scenario: subadmin gets all the groups
    Given user "subadmin" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And group "0" has been created
    And group "España" has been created
    And user "subadmin" has been made a subadmin of group "brand-new-group"
    When user "subadmin" gets all the groups using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the groups returned by the API should be
      | España          |
      | admin           |
      | brand-new-group |
      | 0               |


  Scenario: normal user cannot get a list of all the groups
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And group "brand-new-group" has been created
    And group "0" has been created
    And group "España" has been created
    When user "Alice" gets all the groups using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "997"
    And the HTTP status code should be "401"
    And the API should not return any data
