Feature: add groups
  As an admin
  I want to be able to add groups
  So that I can more easily manage access to resources by groups rather than individual users

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: admin creates a group
    When the administrator sends a group creation request for the following groups using the provisioning API
      | groupname   | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | EspaÃ±aÂ§Ã Ã´Å“â‚¬ | special European and other characters |
      | à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤²à¥€        | Unicode group name                    |
    Then the OCS status code of responses on all endpoints should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
    And these groups should exist:
      | groupname   |
      | simplegroup |
      | EspaÃ±aÂ§Ã Ã´Å“â‚¬ |
      | à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤²à¥€        |

  # A group name must not end in "/subadmins" because that would create ambiguity
