Feature: add users to group
  As a admin
  I want to be able to add users to a group
  So that I can give a user access to the resources of the group

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"

  @smokeTest @skipOnLDAP
  Scenario: adding a user to a group
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname   |
      | simplegroup |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä        |
    When the administrator adds the following users to the following groups using the provisioning API
      | username       | groupname   | comment                               |
      | brand-new-user | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |
      | brand-new-user | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨ | special European and other characters |
      | brand-new-user | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä        | Unicode group name                    |
    Then the OCS status code of responses on all endpoints should be "100"
    And the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
