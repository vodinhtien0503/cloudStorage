Feature: actions on a locked item are possible if the token is sent with the request

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: rename a file in a locked folder
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "/PARENT/parent.txt" to "/PARENT/renamed-file.txt" sending the locktoken of folder "PARENT" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should not exist
    But as "Alice" file "/PARENT/renamed-file.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |
      | old      | shared     |
      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

    And user "Alice" has locked folder "FOLDER" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When user "Alice" moves file "/PARENT/parent.txt" to "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" sending the locktoken of folder "FOLDER" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should not exist
    But as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |

      | old      | exclusive  |
      | new      | shared     |
      | new      | exclusive  |

    When user "Alice" moves file "/PARENT/parent.txt" to "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" sending the locktoken of folder "PARENT/CHILD" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should exist
    But as "Alice" file "/FOLDER/moved-file.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope |

  Scenario Outline: public cannot overwrite a file in a folder locked by the owner even when sending the locktoken
    Given user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file parent" to "PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created a public link share of folder "PARENT" with change permission
