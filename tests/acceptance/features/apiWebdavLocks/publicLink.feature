Feature: persistent-locking in case of a public link

  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT/CHILD"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/CHILD/child.txt"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario Outline: Uploading a file into a locked public folder
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has created folder "FOLDER"
    And user "Alice" has created a public link share of folder "FOLDER" with change permission
    When user "Alice" locks folder "FOLDER" using the WebDAV API setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    Then uploading a file should not work using the <webdav_api_version> public WebDAV API
    And the HTTP status code should be "423"

    Examples:
      | dav-path | lock-scope | webdav_api_version |
      | old      | shared     | old                |
      | old      | exclusive  | old                |

  Scenario Outline: Uploading a file into a locked subfolder of a public folder
    Given user "Alice" has created a public link share of folder "PARENT" with change permission
    And user "Alice" has locked folder "PARENT/CHILD" setting the following properties
      | lockscope | <lock-scope> |
    When the public uploads file "test.txt" with content "test" using the <public-webdav-api-version> public WebDAV API
    And the public uploads file "CHILD/test.txt" with content "test" using the <public-webdav-api-version> public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/CHILD/test.txt" should not exist
    But the content of file "/PARENT/test.txt" for user "Alice" should be "test"
    Examples:
      | public-webdav-api-version | lock-scope |
      | new                       | shared     |

    When the public uploads file "parent.txt" with content "test" using the <public-webdav-api-version> public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "423"

  Scenario Outline: Public locking is not supported
    Given user "Alice" has created a public link share of folder "PARENT" with change permission
