Feature: changing a public link share

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "PARENT"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "PARENT/parent.txt"


  Scenario Outline: Public can or can-not delete file through publicly shared link depending on having delete permissions using the public WebDAV API
    Given user "Alice" has created a public link share with settings
      | path        | /PARENT       |
      | permissions | <permissions> |
    When the public deletes file "parent.txt" from the last public share using the <webdav_api_version> public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And as "Alice" file "PARENT/parent.txt" <should-or-not> exist

    @notToImplementOnOCIS @issue-ocis-2079
    Examples:
      | permissions               | http-status-code | should-or-not | webdav_api_version |
      | read,update,create        | 403              | should        | old                |
      | read,update,create,delete | 204              | should not    | old                |

      | read,update,create,delete | 204              | should not    | new                |


  Scenario Outline: Public link share permissions work correctly for renaming and share permissions read,update,create with the public WebDAV API
    Given user "Alice" has created a public link share with settings
      | path        | /PARENT            |
      | permissions | read,update,create |
    When the public renames file "parent.txt" to "newparent.txt" from the last public share using the <webdav_api_version> public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should exist
    And as "Alice" file "/PARENT/newparent.txt" should not exist
