  Scenario Outline: admin deletes a group
    Given group "<group_id>" has been created
    When the administrator deletes group "<group_id>" using the provisioning API
    Then the OCS status code should be "200"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And group "<group_id>" should not exist
    Examples:
      | group_id    | comment                               |
      | simplegroup | nothing special here                  |

      | 50%25=0             | %25 literal looks like an escaped "%"   |
      | 50%2Eagle           | %2E literal looks like an escaped "."   |
      | 50%2Fix             | %2F literal looks like an escaped slash |

    And group "<group_id2>" has been created
