Feature: remove a user from a group
  As an admin
  I want to be able to remove a user from a group
  So that I can manage user access to group resources

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "2"

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: admin removes a user from a group
    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And these groups have been created:
      | groupname       | comment                               |
      | brand-new-group | nothing special here                  |
      | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨     | special European and other characters |
      | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä            | Unicode group name                    |
    And the following users have been added to the following groups
      | username       | groupname           |
      | brand-new-user | brand-new-group     |
      | brand-new-user | Espa√±a¬ß√†√¥≈ì‚Ç¨         |
      | brand-new-user | ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä                |
    When the administrator removes the following users from the following groups using the provisioning API
      | username       | groupname           |
      | brand-new-user | brand-new-group     |

    Then the OCS status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
    And the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "200"
    And the following users should not belong to the following groups
      | username       | groupname           |
