Feature: sharing

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |

  Scenario Outline: Delete all group shares
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And group "grp1" has been created
    And user "Brian" has been added to group "grp1"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "fileToShare.txt"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "fileToShare.txt" with group "grp1"
    When user "Alice" deletes the last share using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And user "Brian" should not see the share id of the last share
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
      | 2               | 200             |
