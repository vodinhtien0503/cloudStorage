  Scenario Outline: Share a file inside a local external storage
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "/local_storage/filetoshare.txt"
    When user "Alice" shares file "/local_storage/filetoshare.txt" with user "Brian" using the sharing API
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    And the fields of the last response to user "Alice" sharing with user "Brian" should include
      | share_with             | %username%                     |
      | share_with_displayname | %displayname%                  |
      | file_target            | /filetoshare.txt               |

      | share_type             | user                           |
    And as "Brian" file "/filetoshare.txt" should exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
