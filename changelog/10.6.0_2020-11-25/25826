Bugfix: Google Drive file modifications should not create duplicate files
Change: Allow Storage backends to explicitly opt-in/opt-out of marking file as partial while uploading

Existing files in Google Drive that were modified and saved (uploaded) would result in duplicate files of the same name. The root cause was appending .part to filenames for upload. This update first allows Storage to opt-out of .part filenames during upload and second opts out of .part filenames for Google Storage backend specifically.
