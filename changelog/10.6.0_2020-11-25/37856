Change: Use a debug log level if a share download is aborted

If a client was downloading a file through a public link share
and he decided to disconnect and abort the download, ownCloud was
logging that exception.
Now ownCloud will log a message with a debug level instead of logging
the exception in order to reduce the noise.
