Enhancement: Support pre-signed urls

ocis-web (Phoenix) doesn't use cookies for authentication but the "Bearer" header.

This means that we can only fetch data using XHR or the fetch API but cannot use URLs directly in image tags, also cannot download files directly.

To solve this, we now support pre-signed URLs. This means that before creating an image tag or starting a download, we send an authenticated request to the server (OC 10 or OCIS) to ask for a pre-signed URL pointing at a specific resource. Then said URL can be forwarded either to an image tag (for thumbnails) or to another browser window to trigger a download.
