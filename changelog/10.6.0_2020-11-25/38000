Enhancement: Allow getting the share list filtered by share type via API

Previously, the share API returned all the shares. There were some filters,
but you weren't able to filter by share type. You couldn't get only your
link shares.

Now the API allows filtering by share type, along with the filters previously
available. The web UI is using this filtering now.
