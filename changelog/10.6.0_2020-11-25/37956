Bugfix: Add a configurable number of retries on unsuccessful mountpoint move

Handling of conflicting mountpoints across different share backends was improved 
by adding a configurable number of the mountpoint rename attempts. Now when the
mountpoint rename has been failed on the user filesystem initialization due to 
internal backend-specific reasons the used mountpoint name is considered
to be taken, a new name is generated and the rename operation could be repeated
several times until it either succeeds or rename attempts limit is reached.
