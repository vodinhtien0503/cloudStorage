Bugfix: Fix problem with the market app installing an app using OpenIDConnect

The OpenIDConnect app uses an in-memory cache to store an OpenID session
in order to avoid hitting the OpenID provider too much.
After an app was installed, the prefix used to store information in the cache was
changing. This was causing problems because the OpenIDConnect app thought the
OpenID session was no longer valid and, as a consequence, it was logging out the
user. In practice, installing an new app with the market app having logged in via
OpenIDConnect would cause the user to logout.

Now, the cache prefix only changes after an ownCloud upgrade. Installing an app
won't cause the cache prefix to change, so this will fix the problem.
The OpenIDConnect app will still find the stored session information after the
new apps are installed.
