Bugfix: fix decoding of calendars uri

In case an user had calendars uri containing special characters, for instance "pers√∂nlich", and this user was then invited to a calendar event, the event could not be created and a 404 was shown in the stack trace. Reason for this was the uri not being properly decoded. The behavior has now been fixed.
