Bugfix: Fix file target in the accept share API call

If you had a custom share_folder set in the config.php file and the auto-accept
feature for the internal user sharing was disabled, when a user accepted the
user share, the file target in the API response contained the share_folder
duplicated. This was limited to the API response.

Now the API responds correctly, and the file target doesn't have
the share_folder duplicated
