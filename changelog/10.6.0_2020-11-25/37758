Enhancement: Add Support for SGI Image Previews

We added support for Silicone Graphics images previews. The following file extensions will be supported: .sgi, .rgb, .rgba, .bw, .int, .inta. These files will be associated with the mimetype image/sgi. This mimetype is not officially registered. This needs the imagick php extension to be installed.
