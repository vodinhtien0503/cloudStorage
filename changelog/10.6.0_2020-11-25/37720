Change: Add settings checkbox to enable manual file locking

A checkbox to enable manual file locking on clients has been added to
admin settings, additional, manual file locking. This checkbox is an alternative
way to enable manual file locking on clients that support it. The occ command
can also still be used - occ config:app:set files enable_lock_file_action --value yes
