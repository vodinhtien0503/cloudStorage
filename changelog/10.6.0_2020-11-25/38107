Bugfix: SSL check when adding a public link to your ownCloud

Prior to this fix, a SSL certificate check was performed when adding a
public link to your ownCloud. As this check was done on the base URL of the
server, it could cause some issues, for example endless redirect loops.
This fix gets rid of the SSL check because the storage-check afterwards
also checks the validity of the server's SSL certificate. This check is
being made on /status.php, thus it likely wont end up in a redirect loop.
