Bugfix: Checksums will be kept when a file is uploaded or a version is created

Previously, reuploading the same file caused the checksum of the file to be
reset. In addition, the checksum weren't being carried away when a new version
of the file was created. This means that the versions didn't have a checksum.

Both problems are now solved.
