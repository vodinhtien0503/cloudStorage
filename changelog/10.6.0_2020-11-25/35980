Enhancement: Cleanup encryption config values on disabling encryption

occ encryption:disable command was changed to delete some encryption-specific
config key-value pairs that made reenabling encryption not possible.
A safety check was added to prevent disabling encryption until all files are
decrypted. The occ encryption:disable command exits with an error code and message
if the system still has any encrypted files.
