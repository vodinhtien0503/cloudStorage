Enhancement: Add support for date expiration on remote shares

An expiration date can be set now for shares originating in your server.
This feature behaves the same as the expiration for user, group and link shares.

The expiration is controlled in the source server (server A). The target server
(server B) won't know about the expiration. Once the share expires, the target server
(server B) won't be able to access to those shares and it will remove them automatically

This feature won't work for shares that are grabbed from a public link:
if source server (server A) shares a file / folder via link, and an user from the
target server (server B) adds that link to his ownCloud; in this case, this "remote
share expiration" won't apply.

In addition, the same as happens with user, group and link shares, the share recipient
won't have control over the expiration date.
