Bugfix: Pick the translations from templates included from other apps

Some apps can include template parts from a different app, normally from core.
From example, the activity app can include content from the core templates to
be used in the activity email.

The translated strings were picked from the original app even though the
template was within core space. As a result, some string weren't translated
because of the missing translation for those strings in the original app.
Note that core had the strings correctly translated.

Now the translations are picked from the requested app template as intended,
instead of looking for them in the original app.
