Bugfix: Show all shares in the "shared with you" section

Previously, when a user received some shares from multiple remote servers
and one of them was removed, the "shared with you" section didn't show any
share even though the user still had other shares that were accessible in
other remote servers.

This is now fixed by ignoring those non-accessible remote shares. The rest
of the shares will be shown.
