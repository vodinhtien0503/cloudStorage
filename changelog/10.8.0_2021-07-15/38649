Change: Improve performance for the MOVE operation

Previously, in order to move a folder, we needed to get all the content
and replace the path of each one one by one.
Now we replace the path of all the content in one DB query, which reduces
the network traffic and allows better optimization in the DB.
This change affects MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql, and Oracle. Sqlite is excluded
from this optimization and will use the previous behaviour.
