Change: All mount configuration items marked as passwords will be encrypted

Previously, only some known configuration items were encrypted. This was a
problem for new items that required protection because this required
changes in the core product.

Now, all the items marked as passwords will be encrypted. This will be done
automatically without 3rd party apps needing to do anything. A migration
is also provided to update the items if needed.
