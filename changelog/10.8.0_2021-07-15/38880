Enhancement: Trigger file scan after accepting a federated share

This is necessary as we need the fileId to pass it to the `remoteshare.accepted`
event. The activity app can then hook onto this event and update the activity
by setting the correct fileId.

Also added a short translation for the SUBJECT_REMOTE_SHARE_RECEIVED activity.
