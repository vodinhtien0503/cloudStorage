Bugfix: Include incoming and parent permissions in Share UI subfolder reshares

Before this fix SharePanel in Share UI did not include permissions of both incoming and parent shares 
for subfolder reshares. It caused lack of possibility of resharing such files/folder even 
though server-side permissions allowed it.
