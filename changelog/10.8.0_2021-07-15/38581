Bugfix: Creating self group-reshare should not not share to self

In a scenario where resharing with group that user belongs to, 
permissions and attributes were incorrectly handled in share mount logic when 
permissions for that share got adjusted, or that share got again reshared to another user 
that again reshared with prior user. 
This bugfix prevents creation of self share mount in root folder of the user
