Enhancement: Add more properties to the REPORT result

File Search should be done in the future via WebDAV REPORT requests. ownCloud web is using it. In some cases with other search backends we have more properties to return. `<oc:search-highlights />` => returns am html formatted excerpt of the file content which is highlighting the matching words. `<oc:search-score />` returns a float number score value.
