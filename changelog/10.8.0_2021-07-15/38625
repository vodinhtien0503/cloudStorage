Bugfix: When validating rereshare permission make sure to check parent mountpoint

When receiving reshare for a group from parent folder and subfolder of that folder with lower permission,
further reshares were subject to subfolder reshare permissions due to issue with resolving parent mountpoint.
With this change we now ensure to take parent mountpoint out of received mountpoints
