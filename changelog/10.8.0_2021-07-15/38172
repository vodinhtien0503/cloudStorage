Enhancement: Improve public share federation user interface

This adjustment provides a new way to add a public share to ownCloud.
A new button will be displayed where you can easily add the share to the current
server without entering the string, this requires less user input.
Next to this button, a dropdown menu will be displayed,
where you can see the current server or change the server.
Hitting change a server will now display a prompt with a detailed explanation
and more space to enter another server address.
