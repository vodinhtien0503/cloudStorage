Bugfix: objectids for comments and tags are strings

We were using integers when asking for some information related to comments
and tag. This was working fine, but PHP 7.4.18 made some changes in the
postgresql driver making things more strict. As result, some queries were
failing because that information was stored as string, not integer.

This problem is now fixed, and the queries can run without problems.
