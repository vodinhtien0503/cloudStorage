Bugfix: Delay getting the file info until it's going to be used

Some operations require getting the file info to perform the action.
Previously, this file info was fetched and stored before any operation. In
some cases fetching the file info triggered a file scan that could delay
the whole request considerably.

Now, we fetch the file info only in those operations that require it. There
are some node operations such as getting the file path that don't require
fetching the file info, so those operation won't fetch it, and so a potential
file scan is prevented (for those operations)
