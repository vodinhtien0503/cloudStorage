Enhancement: Improve performance of the SMB log when it is inactive

The SMB connector includes very verbose logs to trace what could have
gone wrong. These logs are disabled by default, but although they're disabled
we still need to check the state to decide whether we want to log or not.

Now, the state check is faster and it takes less time to decide, so the
overall performance of the connector is improved.
