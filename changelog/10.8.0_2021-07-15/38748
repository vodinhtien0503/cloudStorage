Enhancement: Improve mobile user interface on files list

This improvement solves the problem that files and folders with a longer name
than 10 chars will cut off to 7 chars by hiding non-essential meta data.
As well the uploading indicator text on a folders table row will now be
displayed at the beginning to avoid UI glitches.
