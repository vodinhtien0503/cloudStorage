Bugfix: Fix file locks for public shares

When using the new WebDAV API, the node which is used to retrieve file locks
is either of type SharedFile or SharedFolder. Both these types do not
implement our own node class, so we need to handle them separately. This is
needed to properly handle file locks on public shares when using the new
WebDAV API.
