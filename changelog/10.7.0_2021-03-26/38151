Enhancement: New external storage: SMB Collaborative (shared file IDs))

This new external storage allows the shared use of SMB/CIFS shares among users.
Independent of the use all files and folders will have the same file id.
This allows better collaboration especially in the area of tagging, comments,
private links and any document collaboration like Office Online Server,
Collabora and OnlyOffice.
