Bugfix: Fix storage lookup in versions when storing a new version

Versioning has been integrated with the new storage based versioning IVersionedStorage.
Until today this was only tested with objectstore versioning which is hooked up as primary storage.
When trying to access a versioned storage which is mounted as non-root this logic did not work out.
