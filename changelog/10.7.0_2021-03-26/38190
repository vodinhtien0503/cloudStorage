Bugfix: Show the share list even if some shares point to unavailable storages

Previously, if some shares pointed to file nodes that belonged to unavailable
storages, the share list wouldn't show any share due to the exception not being
handled correctly.

Now, the exception is handled. The affected shares will be ignored (an error
message will appear in the log with the exception), and the rest of the shares
will show in the web UI.

Note that the steps to reproduce the problem are still unclear, and it might
be impossible to reproduce the issue using recent ownCloud versions. So far,
not only it seems required to have a share pointing to an unavailable storage,
but also there has to be a pending modification for ownCloud to scan the file.
Such conditions shouldn't be possible at the same time.
