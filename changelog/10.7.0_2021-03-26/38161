Enhancement: Allow mounting a subfolder from Google Drive

You can now define a subfolder from your Google Drive when mounting.
This gives the ability to:
 subfolder = empty (like you have it without this enhancment)
 subfolder = name
 subfolder = name/$user
When using encryption, only the subfolder when used gets encrypted.
