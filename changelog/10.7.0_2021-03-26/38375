Bugfix: Fix broken signature when a backup copy is generated

Previously, when a user uploaded a file and then moved it to a shared folder
in order for a second user to get the file, a copy of the file was generated
inside the share owner's trashbin. This allowed the share owner to restore
the file into the share again if needed.
Using encryption, that backup copy was wrongly generated and couldn't be
decrypted due to a wrong signature.

This issue is now fixed, and the backup copy can be restored normally.
