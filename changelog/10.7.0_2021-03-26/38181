Bugfix: Don't redirect if the browser ask for a .properties file

In order to provide translations, the files_pdfviewer app requested a
.properties file. This request failed because the server redirected it to
the default page (the files view), so the app couldn't get the translations

This redirection doesn't happen any longer, and the app can translate the
UI elements now.
