Enhancement: Context menu for files in case multiple actions apply

When triggering the default action for a file which can be opened or edited
with more than one app, a new context menu is displayed. This menu will
ask the user with which app the corresponding file should be opened.

This also solves the problem with some apps which set themselves as
default without asking or even informing the user.
