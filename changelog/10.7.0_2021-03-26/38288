Enhancement: Improve the UX in the external storage settings page

When a user adds or edits an external storage, the user will see a notification if the storage has been added or an error occured.
When a user hovers over the status indicator, the user will see a pointer cursor, this clarifies that a click will result in a config (re-)check.
