Bugfix: Prevent multiple calls by not registering the same listener twice

Going back and forth among the file sections ("all files", "shared with you",
etc) was making some event listeners to be registered twice or more times.
This was causing the same ajax request to be called several times causing
unnecessary load in the server.

Now, these additional requests won't happen
