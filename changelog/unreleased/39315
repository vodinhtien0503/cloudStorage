Bugfix: Allow renaming two files with the same name but different paths

With this change, we allow renaming a file to an existing file name,
when the path differs.
This happens for example when the user creates the file
'/mydirname/text.txt' and '/mytext.txt' then marks both as favorite, and then navigates to the Favorites
and renames 'mytext.txt' to 'text.txt'
