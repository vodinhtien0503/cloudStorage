Enhancement: Hide accept and decline share text on mobile view

Before this PR within the "Shared with you" files list, a text for accept
and decline was shown next to the associated icon.
These texts were using excessive space in the mobile view and might
leave the "State" column not completely visible.
This has been fixed with this PR through hiding those unnecessary texts.
