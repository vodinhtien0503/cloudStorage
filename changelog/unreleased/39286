Enhancement: Add support for MariaDB 10.6

With this change support for MariaDB 10.6 has been added.
If it is a fresh ownCloud installation, MariaDB 10.6 can be used right away.
For upgrading from an older version the command 'occ db:restore-default-row-format'
has been introduced to remove the deprecated row_format 'compressed' from the
ownCloud database tables and set it to the default value.
