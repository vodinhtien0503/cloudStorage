Enhancement: Redesign group list in the user settings view

Before this PR, the group list settings were confusing as the user needs to
click on a group first before the trash bin icon appears to delete a group.
As well the user count was nondescript.
With this PR, a redesign takes care of those issues and also fixes the problem
that while deleting a group in the group list,
it was still available in the user group list.
Furthermore, after deleting a group, the user will be redirected to the
'Everyone' group summary view.
Also fixes an issue where the 'active'-class on a newly created group
was duplicated.
