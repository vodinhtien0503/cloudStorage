Enhancement: Add command to verify all available doc links

All available doc links can now be tested and verified via `make test-doc-links`. It is also possible to 
specify the ownCloud version to look for in the docs via `make test-doc-links DOC_LINK_VERSION=10.7`.
It defaults to the ownCloud version of the current installation.
