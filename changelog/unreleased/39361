Bugfix: Clicking in the middle of the row in the file list downloads the file

This change addresses the issue if the user clicks in on a row in the file list,
the file gets downloaded or open with the default viewer.
This was not intended, the download or default opening should only happen if
the user clicks directly on the file name.
Problems with mobile devices, where the file name was too long to display,
has been also solved.
