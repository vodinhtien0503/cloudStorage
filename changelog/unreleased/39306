Bugfix: Sanitize data send to the server while creating users via webUI

Before this change toggle between 'Set password for new users' option,
may preserve and send unwanted password or email information.
This has been fixed, the webUI will not send email data to the server
if the option 'Set password for new users' is active,
vice versa password won't be sent if the option is disabled.
