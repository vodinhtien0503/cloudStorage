Enhancement: Use icons + buttons instead of text for file actions in mobile view

Before this PR, as files were selected in the files list, actions was shown with
icon and text, for example: 'Download' and 'Delete'.
This uses much space and UI glitches are possible due to limited screen size.
With this PR we now show buttons with the associated icons without any text.
