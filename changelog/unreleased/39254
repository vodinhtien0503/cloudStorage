Bugfix: Command occ 'user:report' might not count 'user directories' correctly

Before this PR the underlying function of 'user:report' just looked up in the
'datadirectory' set in 'config.php'.
This implies that user directories which are symlinks or even not in the
'datadirectory', have not been taken into account.
With this PR we check if the user's home path exists and increase the
'user directories' count.
