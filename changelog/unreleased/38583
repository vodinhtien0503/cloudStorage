Change: Enable streaming for propfind requests

Propfind requests will now be streamed to reduce memory usage
with large responses.
Additionally, the new config `dav.propfind.depth_infinity` has been
added to tell clients whether `depth=infinity` is allowed for
propfind requests. It defaults to true.
