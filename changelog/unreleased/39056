Enhancement: Show create and cancel buttons in the 'New file menu'

If the user hits the '+' button in the UI, a context menu will be shown,
where the user is able to choose for example 'Folder'.
A form will show up to set the new folder name, the user needs to confirm
by hitting the enter key.
This might not been understood by every user at the first glance.
Therefore, with this PR a create and cancel button has been added.
